    <h1>Homeless Children in the U.S.A.</h1>

    <p class="article">
        One in 45 children experience homelessness in America each year.  That's over 1.6 million children.  While homeless, they experience high rates of acute and chronic health problems.  The constant barrage of stressful and traumatic experience also has profound effects on their development and ability to learn.</p>

   <!-- <p class ="article">Today, the number of children (under age 18) in the United States is at an all-time high of 74.2 million. But, the share of the national population who are children is at an all time low.</p>-->
    <p class = "article">America's homeless children are mostly unseen, but they are counted. The troubling part is that these numbers have been climbing for some time now. In the 2011 school year, enrollment statistics in preschools and K-12 programs reported a figure of 1,168,354 children known to be homeless.</p>
